We want you, the visitor to the App, to understand how we collect and use data about your visit to and use of the App. The privacy policy below identifies what information the App collects, and what it is used for.

We may also disclose your information if required to do so by law. The privacy policy for the App is set forth below and you should contact privacy@cardinalhealth.com if you have questions or concerns about this policy or the use of your information.</p>
